First you will have to upload shapefile from postgis then follow below setting

Phase 1: Prepare GeoServer
Before writing code, you must ensure GeoServer allows these changes.

Enable WFS-T:

Log in to GeoServer.

Go to Services > WFS.

Ensure Service Level is set to "Transactional" or "Complete".

Click Save.

Enable CORS (Crucial):

If your website is on localhost:3000 and GeoServer is on localhost:8080, your browser will block the request unless CORS is enabled in GeoServer's web.xml file.

Quick fix for testing: You can use a browser extension like "CORS Unblock" temporarily, but for production, you must edit the GeoServer web.xml configuration.

Check Security:

Go to Data Security in GeoServer.

Ensure your workspace/layer has Write permission enabled for the user you are connecting as.
